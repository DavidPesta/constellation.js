constellation.js

A point-based grid layout and geometry search application by Greg MacWilliam.

This application explores geometry management for a 2D motion grid, inspired by the geometry system built for Lassie Adventure Studio. The Lassie engine never matured beyond a point grid with rectangle-based point trapping and free motion regions. Constellation intends to reproduce these features using a polygon-based grid. Current application features include:

 - Point and polygon grid creation.
 - Pathfinding using A-star.
 - Polygon hit test with ray scanning.
 - Point snapping for line segments.
 - Nearest-neighbor search.
 - Saved layouts via local storage.
